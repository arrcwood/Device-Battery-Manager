Last updated: November 2, 2025

Welcome to [Device Battery Manager]! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the [Device Battery Manager] mobile application (“the app,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). By using the app, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

# 1. Description of Service

[Device Battery Manager] is a local battery tracking tool that helps users record information about household replaceable batteries and the devices that use them. The app allows you to track when batteries were last changed, what type of battery each device uses, and an estimated battery life—all stored locally on your device.

# 2. No Accounts or Cloud Services

The app does not require you to create an account, sign in, or connect to the internet. All data you enter remains stored only on your device. We do not host, collect, or store your information on external servers.

# 3. Personal Responsibility

You are responsible for any data you enter into the app and for maintaining your own device backups. If you uninstall the app or reset your device, your locally stored data may be lost unless you’ve backed it up through your device’s operating system.

# 4. No Warranty

The app is provided “as is” and “as available”, without any warranties of any kind.
We make no guarantees that the app will be free of bugs, errors, or interruptions, or that its battery life estimates will be accurate. The estimates are speculative and provided for convenience only.

# 5. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, [Device Battery Manager] and its developers will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the app—including data loss, inaccurate battery estimates, or device malfunctions.

All code, design, and content associated with [Device Battery Manager] are the intellectual property of [Device Battery Manager]. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer any part of the app without prior written consent.

# 7. Updates and Modifications

We may update or modify the app or these Terms from time to time. Any significant changes will be noted in the app or through the app store listing. Continued use of the app after changes take effect means you accept the revised Terms.

# 8. Termination

You may stop using the app at any time by uninstalling it. We reserve the right to discontinue the app or restrict access to it at our discretion, without notice.

# 9. Governing Law
